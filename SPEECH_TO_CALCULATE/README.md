- https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/#picking-a-python-speech-recognition-package
- python speak_loop.py
- the script will tell you to start speaking, then say them back to you
- You can add numbers up to 10 if you use the keyword 'calculate'
- appends any calculations to a file in the MATH directory, recording the date and time


## Lessons
- uses google_audio api, imports custom modules, uploads all background noise to the mothership
- the use of __pycache__ 

## Additional Modules

- speech_calc_total.py - merging lists to create a dictionary mapping text to integers (1-10) 
- speech_calc_file.py - create MATH directory, append 'calculation' record to file with a timestamp
- speak_loop.py - say 'stop' to end the program, otherwise this is where it all starts
